# HC11_miRNA_analysis_pipeline
Execute Normalized_count.sh on fasta files of mouse mature, star and hairpin and mature microRNA sequences of other species to generate normalized count of mature and novel miRNAs for a sample. Use miRNAs_expressed_all_samples file from above and run Codes_P_N.R for defferential gene expression analysis.
